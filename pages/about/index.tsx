          <p>
            CLOVR Music is a multi-faceted record label. We aim to provide
            excellent quality music and also to support the community of
            producers through our sample packs, community, and other resources.
          </p>

            We focus primarily on lo-fi beats and chillhop with an emphasis on
            good melodies, an upbeat vibe, and sometimes a jazzy edge. We try to
            have a distinct sound by emphasizing the positive emotion that music
            can bring.
